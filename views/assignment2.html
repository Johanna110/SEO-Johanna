      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>	<p><b>DOMAIN NAME STRATEGY</b> - is to proactively protect your brand online by reducing the chance for others to use your brand name in their online activities, specifically, in their website URLs.</p>

<p><b>LINKING STRATEGY</b> - Using anchor text to link to specific deep pages on a site, as well as the home page, can certainly help from a ranking perspective. Data still shows that we see incremental lift in associated rankings and traffic when we accomplish these tasks. </p>

<p><b>KEYWORD STRATEGY</b> - Using Keywords in Your Campaigns. Keyword Strategies are essential to developing winning search engine marketing campaigns. ... The best keyword strategies rely on highly relevant keywords, which are keywords that relate closely to your business or are associated with your industry.</p>

<p><b>META DESCRIPTION TAGS</b> - The meta description tag in HTML is the 160 character snippet used to summarize a web page’s content. Search engines sometimes use these snippets in search results to let visitors know what a page is about before they click on it. In this post, we will look at how search engines use meta descriptions, what the top SEO blogs say about meta descriptions & whether they still use them, and reasons why you should use them.</p>

<p><b>ALT TAGS STRATEGY</b> - In the murky waters of search engine optimization (SEO) rests a lot of technical terminology like meta data, title tags and backlinks. If you’re trying to get SEO in order, it can be especially overwhelming to know where to start. Fortunately, SEO is often taken piece by piece and each element contributes to an overall strategy for success. Search gurus have talked a lot about how search engines crawl and index websites and the importance of optimizing your content to increase your organic search rank. One important piece that’s often overlooked is ensuring images on your site are appropriately labeled or “tagged.” Paying attention to the alternative text (often referred to as alt tags or alt attributes) can increase your chances of search engine success. Most importantly, alt tags provide a description of an image for those who have disabilities and rely on screen readers to navigate the Web. This is a great example of the importance of writing Web content for people and not for search engine robots. Usability and relevance to your users should always be at the forefront of your efforts. In SEO terms, alt tags make it possible for search engines to properly read and understand what an image is conveying. In other words, it’s one more element on your site for search engines to crawl and another chance for you to infuse your keywords (assuming the image is relevant to your keywords). It will also help you think more strategically about the images on your page to make sure you’re maximizing your targeted keywords.</p>

<p><b>SEARCH ENGINE INDEXING</b> - Returning the results for short tail keywords might be an easy job for search engines.But now as the trend is towards long tail keywords, search engines have a doctored a difference indexing mechanism for returning results for long tail keywords.The indexing mechanism is latent semantic indexing. In latent semantic indexing search engines, determine the relationship between different entities or part of a blog content. By understanding this relationship between different entities, search engines understand the context meaning of the blog content easily.Once the content is understood properly by search engines, it is easy for them to return accurate results for long tail keywords.Search engine users started to give more complex search queries than never before. Therefore, the search engines have developed the technique of processing natural language search queries.Because of this algorithm, Google Graph Search came into existence. Search engines like Google are now returning the results or answers for the search queries straight away without leading us to other blog content.As a conclusion, I can say that, the algorithm used by search engines for processing long tail search queries is Latent Semantic Indexing Algorithm.</p></span></div>
