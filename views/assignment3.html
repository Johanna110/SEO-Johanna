      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>   <p>On page SEO is what you do on your own website or blog in order to enhance the traffic. It is the first thing that every webmaster should look into. On page optimization needs constant revision of the site in order to improve and maintain the ranking. In this technique, the role of keywords or key phrases that the user might type has a prominent position. It includes headings, page titles, domain names and images. But all these elements have to be search-engine friendly. The size of the site should not be too large or too small. It should have genuine, interesting and relevant content. The main components involved in on-page optimization are listed below: – Headings – Title of the page – Meta description and tags – Image and pictures – URL structure and domain information – User-friendly navigation and quick loading – Fresh and quality content – Optimized external and internal links Let us consider some of the important on page optimization techniques: Title optimization The most important web optimization element is the title tag. The title tag should be a short but descriptive one, which will help the visitors learn more about you and your business. The title tag is indexed on the search engines, so the title tag has greater importance than other components. Your title should be good enough to attract users looking for specific information. Meta tag Meta tag is a short description about your website, its focus areas and the services you provide. In the Meta tag it’s important that the title, keyword and descriptions written are distinct from other sites. Content writing Content writing is a very important feature to drive more traffic to your site.Regularly updating your content with fresh information, and appropriate keywords and phrases increases the ranking of your site. Good content is important for your articles, newspaper, blogs, and press releases as well. Keyword optimization Adding keywords to your site is important but keyword stuffing can make your site unreadable. Link optimization Proper link building improves your site’s quality. There should be effective external and internal links to secure high-ranking in search engines. The link should be taken from a genuine and unique site. Image optimization Image optimization can make your site unique but it should be done according to certain criteria. The first one is the file size and loading speed of an individual image and the second is proper file naming and optimization. Search engine spiders can only read text and not images, so special tags are used to make them comprehensible to search engines. Off page SEO Unlike on page optimization, off page depends on another web page to improve your site or blog. Off-page optimization deals with link building factors. It’s an ongoing process and needs regular new links that are given priority by search engines. In this technique if you obtain a high quality link, then your site can rank higher. Strategic link building increases the traffic to your website and its position in Google. Off page SEO is a combination of social media, social bookmarking and link building.

      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>	<p>Off page ranking, often requires more creativity, ingenuity, and technical prowess to do well. To parse off page rankings, Google looks primarily at the websites that are linking back to a page. If these sites are high quality and authoritative, it stands to reason that your page is valuable. So, how do we make an impact on what happens on websites operated by complete strangers? These five techniques for off page SEO (that marketers can tackle on their own) will give you the most return on your investment of time and effort. Off Page Technique #1: Guest Posting Guest blogging is ranked number one on this list because it’s such a versatile strategy. It gets you very high quality backlinks, but it also increases your site’s exposure and authority to a wider audience. As a bonus, guest posts can also drive referral traffic to your own articles or landing pages, which means they can be a lead generation source in addition to these other great outcomes. The downside to guest posting is that it can be time consuming.</p></div>
